      <b>SU from SO:</b> Ashoka, a young painter in the village Maruluru,
      develops a crush on a woman. One night, while returning from a party, a
      drunk Ashoka peeps through the window of her bathroom. To escape, he acts
      like he is possessed by a ghost. From the next day, he finds himself at
      the center of unwanted attention. In an attempt to get rid of the "ghost",
      a timid priest is called, and Ashoka plays along, saying he is possessed
      by 'Kalpana', the ghost from the popular horror movie Kalpana (which
      itself is a remake of the 2011 Tamil film Kanchana). In the chaos, people
      mishear it as Sulochana. A famous priest, Karunakar Guruji, is called to
      get rid of the "spirit", and he then concludes that Ashoka is indeed
      possessed by a spirit named 'Sulochana', hailing from the neighbouring
      town 'Someshwara'. Bizarre rituals are performed to exorcise the spirit
      from Ashoka's body in vain, as he inadvertently causes people to think
      that he is still possessed. As a last resort, the villagers go to
      Someshwara to find Sulochana, where they find a woman, Bhanu, whose
      mother, Sulochana, died not long ago. She is coincidentally the first
      prospective bride whom Ravi "Anna", a popular man in the village, had
      visited and rejected years ago, and, as fate has it, both are still
      unmarried.

      <b>Mark:</b>Ajay Markandeya, known as Mark (Kiccha Sudeep), is a suspended
      Superintendent of Police in Bengaluru, sidelined after a clash with a
      corrupt politician. His life takes a dramatic turn when a series of
      violent incidents unfold across Karnataka. A brutal mass murder in
      Kolhapur introduces Bhadra (Naveen Chandra), a gangster whose rage stems
      from his brother’s elopement. Meanwhile, Mark rescues a group of policemen
      from rowdies in Bengaluru, pulling him back into active duty. The
      investigation deepens when Mark’s mother is stabbed and Archana’s
      daughter, the caretaker’s child, is abducted. He discovers a large-scale
      child kidnapping racket, with nearly twenty children missing. As Mark
      races against time, a political conspiracy surfaces: the Chief Minister is
      murdered in a hospital, and his son Adikeshav (Shine Tom Chacko) kills his
      own mother to seize power. The nexus between the drug mafia, child
      trafficking, and political ambition becomes clear. Mark faces betrayal
      within his own ranks while battling Bhadra’s gang and rescuing the
      abducted children. In a high-octane climax, he exposes Adikeshav and
      dismantles the criminal cartel, restoring law and clearing his name. The
      narrative unfolds over a tight 24-hour window, blending intense action,
      emotional stakes, and political intrigue
