      <dd>
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
        JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
        inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide
        Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
        maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
        explicit presentational HTML since 1997.A form of HTML, known as HTML5,
        is used to display video and audio.

      <dd>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
        including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve
        content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern
        for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the
        specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
        to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
        file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
        and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
        between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

      <dd>
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[12] It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
